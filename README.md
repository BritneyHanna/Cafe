# Cafe Mugs

This website was built with vanilla Javascript HTML and CSS and uses the animate on scroll library for seamless animations.



## Getting Started

This is a simple static website the easiest way to launch this app is using the LiveServer Extenstion in VS code 



## Where to find Animate on Scroll
If you click the link and scroll down you'll see a demonstration of the different scroll effects. Clicking on the github icon will take to the original repo kindly provided by the creators.

## Future Optimizations 

There are some alignment issues with the form elements where the overall result is not aesthetic. I do plan to revise this in the future
